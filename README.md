# coolApp
Just some rather simple site I had to do as a part of a test. Design consists of few JSP pages. Logics behind everything is written in Java using servlets, POJOs and other helper classes. It also has integration with database in form of MySQL.

App has following features: 
- Login / Registration 
- Logged user can edit his profile info
- Logged user can delete his profile
-	Logout
